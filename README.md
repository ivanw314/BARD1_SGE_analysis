# BARD1_SGE_analysis

This repository contains all Python notebooks and scripts used to filter data and create figures used in the BARD1 SGE paper. All notebooks/scripts are organized into one of two folders. Notebooks and Scripts. Datasets used to generate figures are located in the Data folder.

## Notebooks
The Notebooks folder contains Python Notebooks that create individual panels used in the final figures. The vizualization that will be created by each notebook is noted in the name of the notebook. For the intricacies of each notebook, notebooks have been commented out.

These notebooks are:


## Scripts
The Scripts folder contains two types of files: Python scripts used to generated figures in PyMOL and the Python notebook used to filter all data prior to figure generation. All scripts are labeled with what visualization they will create once run in PyMOL. Specifics for running each script are included within commented annotations in each individual script. 

These scripts are:

## Data
This folder contains information needed to run notebooks for figure generation. This includes the raw SGE scores in TSV format as well as data from databases such as ClinVar and gnomAD.
